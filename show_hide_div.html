  You can't because range sum query is affected by overlapping parts. Sparse table can answer query in constant time for only some special queries in which overlapping does not cause any change to our answer. Like range maximum query. Though you can also use it to answer range sum query but that will take log(N) time. Think how you can use the existing calculated information to answer that. Let me know in the comments.
</div>

<script>
  function myFunction() {
    var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
    if (x.style.display === "none") {
      x.style.display = "block";
    } else {
      x.style.display = "none";
    }
  }
</script>
